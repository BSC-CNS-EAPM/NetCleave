# UniProt

We will need the uniprot database in order parse MS peptides. In order to do so, first, we need to (1) download, (2) uncompress the UniProt database. In order to do so, please:

1. Download fasta file **Reviewed (Swiss-Prot)** from https://www.uniprot.org/downloads
2. Uncompress **uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz** to **uniprot_sprot.fasta**
