<p align="justify">
In brief, NetCleave maps reported IEDB peptides to protein sequences in UniProt/UniParc. After the identification of the C-terminal cleavage site, amino acid sequences are coded using QSAR descriptors, including steric, electrostatic and hydrophobic properties. Finally, a neural network architecture is used to generate the predictive model.

## How to use NetCleave

NetCleave can be used in two different ways: using our pre-computed models, or easily retraining the method and constructing your own models depending on your needs.

### Using pre-trained models

Several pre-trained models are available, which should cover most of the needs of the scientific community. Most common human models available are: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP.

### Retraining the method and constructing your own models

NetCleave was specificaly build to be easily retrained: IEDB is continously being updated and algorithms should be periodically updated. In order to retrain NetCleave method, user needs first to download the last versions of IEDB and UniParc/UniProt.
